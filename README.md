# Introduction

This repository predicts the results of senate and gubernatorial races for the 2022 Midterm Elections as part of a full-class project in a political statistics class in my senior year of high school. Our class developed the methodology and math behind the predictions, but I wrote the code in this repository myself. A few of my classmates wrote code for other parts of the project including scraping polling data and the website (not in this repository). Further information can be found at our [website](https://polistat-site-2022.vercel.app/).
